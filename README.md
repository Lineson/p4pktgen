## Prerequisites

- Python 2.7, pip
- [p4c](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c)
- `simple_switch` from the [behavioral-model](https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model) project

For installing `p4c` and `simple-switch`, there is a
[script](https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide/blob/master/bin/install-p4dev.sh)
by Andy Fingerhut.  Make sure that `simple_switch` is in your path.

Note: this software has been developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04
and likely requires changes to run on other operating systems.


## Installing and running p4pktgen

Running p4pktgen currently requires root privileges because Linux
does not allow unprivileged users to send raw Ethernet packets.

Run p4pktgen's install script as follows:
```bash
% ./tools/install.sh
```

The basic command to run p4pktgen is as follows:

```bash
% p4pktgen <json file>
```

The flag `-d` prints additional debug information.  The `-h` option
gives help on other command line options available.
